This task management app was created to streamline the organization of projects and tasks, providing a collaborative platform inspired by tools like Trello and Jira. It allows users to create projects, manage tasks across multiple statuses, and collaborate in real-time with team members.

### Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Includes registration, login, email confirmation, and middleware validation.
- **Collaborative Features**: Users can invite collaborators, assign roles (manager, collaborator), and track task progress across five statuses: Pending, On Hold, In Progress, Under Review, and Completed.
- **Comprehensive CRUD Functionality**: Every project and task can be created, viewed, updated, or deleted with ease.
- **Advanced Task Management**: Features include a change history and threaded comments for every task.
